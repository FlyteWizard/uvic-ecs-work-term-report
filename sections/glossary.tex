% GLOSSARY
\section*{Glossary}

If the report contains acronyms or terms that may not be familiar to your audience include a glossary explaining these terms. The glossary defines specialized technical terminology including acronyms, listing them in alphabetical order and should appear by itself on a separate page. The list of symbols defines the mathematical symbols used in the report. Any mathematical symbols or constants included in the report should be defined since most mathematical usage is not standardized. A sample glossary is presented in the table below.
